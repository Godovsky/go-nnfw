A simple framework for creating and training neural networks, written in Go. For an example of usage, see the truth_table file.go, where a neural network is implemented that learns to calculate AND, OR, XOR, !AND, !OR, !XOR using a data file data.csv, where the truth table is written. The neural network from this example has 2 inputs and 6 outputs, as well as one hidden layer of 6 neurons.
